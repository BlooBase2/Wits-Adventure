### Technical Stack

| Technology | Reason for Choice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Firebase Auth & Firestore DB** | This was chosen primarily due to familiarity from semester 1, which saves valuable time that would otherwise be spent on learning new tools. Firebase is a robust platform that consolidates several key services, including authentication, real-time user and object data storage (Firestore), and media storage (Cloud Storage), providing an efficient, all-in-one backend solution. |
| **Node.js** | We are using Node.js to host a backend server. This serves a dual purpose: first, it enhances security by restricting all data access to a single point of entry, using the Firebase Admin SDK. This prevents direct, unsecure database calls from every client device. Second, it acts as a load balancer, managing and limiting the flow of data requests to the database. |
| **React** | React was selected for its modular and component-based architecture. This allows us to create reusable components and objects that can be easily used across multiple pages. This approach significantly increases development speed and code maintainability compared to traditional web development with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. |
