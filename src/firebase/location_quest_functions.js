/*  Location Quests
    Made by other users, they upload a picture with some quest title/riddle. In this case the quest is completed by going to the physical location
    and taking an picture. We could potentially make these pictures collectibles, that users can keep on their profile page like old explorers, who
    kept and framed pictures of locations they went to.
